# PM Processes
## PM Process Application
The following PM processes
* should be used during a project as a whole, for individual phases, or both,
* are appropriate for projects in all organizations. 

PM requires significant coordination and, as such, requires each process to be 
* appropriately aligned, and 
* connected with other processes.

Some processes may be repeated to 
* fully define and meet stakeholder requirements, and 
* reach an agreement on the project objectives. \

In conjunction with other project stakeholders, project managers are advised to 
* carefully consider the processes, and 
* apply them as appropriate to the project and organizational needs. 

The processes need not be applied uniformly on all projects or phases. \
Therefore, the project manager should tailor the management processes for each project or phase by determining 
* what processes are appropriate, and 
* the degree of rigor for each process.
The relevant organizational policies should accomplish this tailoring.

For a project to be successful, the following actions should be accomplished:
* select appropriate processes that are required to meet the project objectives;
* use a defined approach to develop or adapt the product specifications and plans to meet the project objectives and requirements;
* comply with requirements to satisfy the project sponsor, customers, and other stakeholders;
* define and manage the project scope within the constraints while considering the project risks and resource needs to provide the project deliverables;
* obtain proper support from each performing organization, including a commitment from the customers and project sponsor.

The PM processes are defined and described in terms of their purposes, the relationships among the processes, the interactions within the processes, and the primary inputs and outputs associated with each process. 

## Process Groups and Subject Groups
### General
The PM processes may be viewed from two different perspectives:
* as **process groups** for the management of the project;
* as **subject groups** for collecting the processes by subject.

### Process Groups
#### General
Each **process group** consists of processes that apply to any project phase or project. \
These processes, further defined in terms of purpose, description, and primary inputs and outputs, are interdependent. \
The process groups are independent of the application area or industry focus.
Any process may be repeated.

#### Initiating 
The _initiating_ processes are used to 
* start a project phase or project, 
* define the project phase or project objectives, and 
* authorize the project manager to proceed with the project work.

#### Planning
The _planning_ processes are used to develop planning detail. 

This detail should be sufficient to 
* establish baselines against which project implementation can be managed, and 
* performance can be measured and controlled.

#### Implementing
The _implementing_ processes are used to 
* perform the project management activities, and 
* support the provision of the project’s deliverables following the project plans.

#### Controlling
The _controlling_ processes are used to monitor, measure, and control project performance against the project plan. \
Consequently, preventive and corrective actions may be taken and change requests made to achieve project objectives when necessary.

#### Closing
The _closing_ processes are used to 
* formally establish that the project phase or project is finished, and 
* provide lessons learned to be considered and implemented as necessary.

#### PM Process Group Interrelationships and Interactions
The management of a project 
* starts with the initiating process group, and 
* finishes with the closing process group. 
 
The interdependency between process groups requires the controlling process group to interact with every other process group.

Process groups are 
* seldom discrete or one-time in their application.
* repeated within each phase to drive the project to completion. \
All or some processes within the process groups may be required for a project phase. \
Not all interactions will apply to all project phases or projects. \
In practice, the processes within the process groups are often 
* concurrent, 
* overlapping, and 
* interacting in ways not shown.

Figure 2 elaborates on Figure 1 to show the interactions among the process groups inside the project's boundaries, including the representative inputs and outputs of processes within the process groups. \
Except for the controlling process group, linkages between the various process groups are through individual processes within each process group. \
While linkage is shown in Figure 2 between the controlling process group and other process groups, it may be considered self-standing because its processes control the overall project and the individual process groups.

### Subject Groups
#### General
Each **subject group** consists of processes applicable to any project phase or project. \
These processes 
* are defined in terms of 
  * purpose, 
  * description, 
  * primary inputs and outputs, and 
* are interdependent.

Subject groups are independent of the application area or industry focus. 

The figures in Annex A illustrate the interactions of the individual processes in each process group identified in 4.2.2 mapped against the subject groups. \
Any process may be repeated.

#### Integration
The _integration_ subject group includes 
* the processes required to identify, define, combine, unify, coordinate, control, and close the various activities, and 
* the processes related to the project.

#### Stakeholder
The _stakeholder_ subject group includes the processes required to identify and manage the project sponsor, customers, and other stakeholders.

#### Scope
The _scope_ subject group includes 
* the processes required to identify and define the work and deliverables, and 
* only the work and deliverables required.

#### Resource
The _resource_ subject group includes the processes required to identify and acquire adequate project resources such as 
* people, 
* facilities, 
* equipment, 
* materials, 
* infrastructure, and 
* tools.

#### Time
The _time_ subject group includes the processes required to 
* schedule the project activities, and 
* to monitor progress in controlling the schedule.

#### Cost
The _cost_ subject group includes the processes required to 
* develop the budget, and
* monitor progress to control costs.

#### Risk
The _risk_ subject group includes the processes required to identify and manage threats and opportunities.

#### Quality
The _quality_ subject group includes the processes required to plan and establish quality assurance and control.

#### Procurement
The _procurement_ subject group includes the processes required to 
* plan and acquire products, services or results, and 
* manage supplier relationships.

#### Communication
The _communication_ subject group includes the processes required to plan, manage and distribute information relevant to the project.
