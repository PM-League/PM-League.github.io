    "\n",
    "This is a reasonable relation linking the output ($S_s$) to the input ($K$, $t_d$ - management parameters) and a constant ($C_k$) which is somehow a measure of the state of technology being applied to the project. \\\n",
    "Adding people to accelerate a project can accomplish this until the gradient condition is reached, but only at a very high cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Effort-Time Tradeoff Law\n",
    "The tradeoff law between effort and time can be obtained\n",
    "explicity from the software equation\n",

    "S_s = C_k K^{1/3} t_d^{4/3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A constant number of source statements ($S_s = \\text{const}$) implies $K t_d^2 = \\text{const}$. \\\n",
    "So, $K = \\text{constant}/t_d^4$, or proportionally, development effort = constat/$t_d^4$, is the effort-development tradeoff law.\n",

    "One other relation is worth obtaining; the one where the\n",
    "average productivity remains constant.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\overline{PR} = C_n D^{-2/3}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the productivity for different projects will be the same\n",
    "only if the difficulty is the same. \\\n",
    "This does not seem reasonable to expect very frequently since the difficulty is a measure of the software work to be done, i.e., $K/t_d^2 = D$  which is a function of the number of files, the number of reports, and the number of programs the system has. \\\n",
    "Thus, planning a new project based on using the same productivity a previous project had, is fallacious unless the difficulty is the same."
