## Agile Principles and Mindset

### The Agile Mindset

#### Declaration of Interdependence (DOI)

* Written in 2005 by Agile Project Leadership Network
* Six Precepts:

> 1. We increase **return on investment** by making continuous flow of value our focus.
> 2. We **deliver reliable results** by engaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership.
> 3. We **expect uncertainty** and manage for it through iterations, anticipation, and adaptation.
> 4. We **unleash creativity** and innovation by recognizing that individuals are the ultimate source of value, and creating an environment where they can make a difference.
> 5. We **boost performance** through group accountability for results and shared responsibility for team effectiveness.
> 6. We **improve effectiveness and reliability** through situationally specific strategies, processes, and practices.

#### The Agile Triangle

| Methodology | Constraint | Variable   |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Predictive  | Scope      | Time, Cost |
| Agile       | Time, Cost | Scope      |

### The Agile Manifesto

#### Four Values

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding** to change over following a plan

#### Twelve Principles

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
>
> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
>
> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
>
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
>
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
>
> Simplicity---the art of maximizing the amount of work not done---is essential.
>
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
>
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjust sits behavior accordingly.

Interpretation: $ROI>1$

##### Present Value (PV)

Formula: $PV = FV_t/(1+r)^t$

##### Net Present Value (NPV)

Formula: $NPV=\sum_{t=0}^{T} CF_t/(1+r)^t$

Interpretation:

* IF $NPV>0$ THEN accept ELSE reject
* Select project with **higher** $NPV$

#### Agile Project Accounting

* Break down product/service into MVP
* Deliver MVP asap
* Exploit opportunities for early benefits by using part of the product/service while completing the remainder

#### Key Performance Indexes

* Rate of Progress
* Remaining Work
* Likely Completion Date
* Likely Costs Remaining

#### Regulatory Compliance

* Regulations $\rightarrow $ safety
* A project that is subejct to regulatory compliance require special documentation to prove that required practices were followed
* Approaches for integrating regulatory compliance:
  * Doing compliance work **during** product development to keep them linked and relevant
  * Doing compliance work **after** product development to avoid rework

### Prioritizing Value

#### Customer-Valued Prioritization

Work on items that maximize value delivered to customer first

#### Prioritization Schemes

##### MoSCoW

| Definition                     | Priority |
| ------------------------------ | -------- |
| **M**ust have            | Top      |
| **S**hould have          | Medium   |

### Deliver Incrementally

Delivering the "plain-vanilla" version of a product/service allows realizing benefits to get an early $ROI$

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

MVP = Package of functionality that is complete enough to be useful to the users or the market, yet still small enough that it does not represent the entire project

#### Agile Tooling

Prefer low tech, high touch tools over sophisticated computerized models

#### Task/Kanban Boards

#### Work in Progress (WIP)

* Work started but not started yet
* Excessive WIP:
  * consumes investment capital and delivers no $ROI$ until converted into product/service
  * hides bottlenecks/inefficiencies
  * increases probability of rework

#### WIP Limits

Set limit to WIP (to Task/Kanban Board)

Optimize ~~resource utilization~~ throughput

#### User Story Backlog (Product Backlog)

#### Refining (Grooming) the Backlog

#### Relative Sizing and Story Points

##### The Fibonacci Sequence

##### Guidelines for Using Story Points

* The team should own the definition of their story points
* Story point estimates shouldbe all-inclusive
* The point sizes should be relative
* When disaggregating estimates, the totals don't need to match
* Complexity, work effort, andrisk should all be included in the estimates

#### Affinity Estimating

#### T-shirt Sizing

ES < S < M < L < XL < XXL

#### Story Maps

#### Wideband Delphi

Biases:

* Bandwagon
* HIPPO
* Groupthink

Characteristics:

* Adaptive
* Collaborative

#### Planning Poker

### Release and Iteration Planning

#### Spikes

##### Architectural Spike

Short, timeboxed effort dedicated to "proof of concept" --- checking whether the approach the team hopes to use will work for the project

##### Risk-Based Spike

Short, timeboxed effort that makes the team sets aside to investigate, reduce or eliminate an issue/threat

#### Release Planning

##### Selecting the User Stories for the Release

##### How Much Can We Get Done?

##### Estimating Velocity for the First Iteration

##### Slicing the Stories

#### Iteration Planning

##### The Iteration Planning Process

* Discuss the user stories in the backlog
* Select the user stories for the iteration
* Define the acceptance criteria and write the acceptance tests for the stories
* Break down the user stories into tasks
* Estimate the tasks

##### Iteration Planning Summary

##### Selecting the User Stories

##### Defining the Acceptance Criteria nad Writing the Acceptance Tests

##### Estimating the Tasks

##### Use Actual Results to Refine Estimates

### Daily Stand-Ups

## Problem Detection and Resolution

### Detecting Problems

#### Lead Time and Cycle Time

$Task.LT=Time(ToDo \rightarrow Done)$

##### Cycle Time, WIP, and Throughput

$CT=WIP/TH$

##### Throughput and Productivity

$TH=Work/Time$

$Productivity=Work/TeamMember$

#### Defects

$Defect.CT=Time(Occurred \rightarrow Fixed)$

##### Defect Rates

$DefectRate=\#Defect/Time$

#### Variance Analysis

##### Causes of Variation

* Common cause = average day-2-day differences of doing work
* Special cause = greater degree of variance $\leftarrow$ special/new factors

#### Trend Analysis

Metrics

* Lagging $\rightarrow$ view of past
* Leading $\rightarrow$ view of future/what is occurring now/starting to happen $\rightarrow$ can adapt/replan accordinly

#### Control Limits

### Managing Threats and Issues

#### Risk-Adjusted Backlog

##### Creating the Risk-Adjusted Backlog

$EVM = Probability \cdot Impact [\$]$

#### Risk Severity

$Severity=Probability \cdot Impact [l/m/h]$

#### Risk Burndown Graphs

### Solving Problems

#### Problem Solving as Continuous Improvement

#### Engage the Team

##### The Benefits of Team Engagement

* By asking the team for a solution, we inherit consensus for the proposal
* Engaging the team accesses a broader knowledge base
* Team solutions are practical
* When consulted, people work hard to generate good ideas
* Asking for help shows confidence, not weakness
* Seeking others' ideas models desired behavior

##### Considerations and Cautions for Engaging the Team

* Involve the team where it can be most helpful
* Solve real problems
* Team cohesion is necessary
* Check in after team or project changes
* Be sure to follow through

## Continuous Improvement

### Kaizen

Kaizen = process for continuous improvement

Focus on:

* encourage the team
* frequently initiate and implement small, incremental improvements

PDCA Cycle = Plan - Do - Check - Act

### Continuous Improvement---Process

#### Process Tailoring

Process tailor = adapting our implementation of agile to better fit our project environment

Teams new to agile should use their methodology "out-of-the-box" for a few projects before attempting to change it

All techniques and practices in an agile methodology are designed to work in balance with each other

##### Hybrid Models

###### Agile-Agile Hybrid: Scrum-XP

| Methodology | Focus              |

##### Methodology Success Patterns

* Interactive, face-to-face communication is the cheapest channel for exchanging information
* Excess methodology weight is costly
* Larger teams need heavier methodologies
* Projects with greater criticality require greater ceremony
* Feedback and communication reduce the need for intermediate deliverables
* Discipline, skills, and understanding counter process, formality, and coumentation
* Efficiency is expendable in nonbottleneck activities

#### Value Stream Mapping

##### Process

1. Identify product/service to be analyzed
2. Create a value stream map of the current process, identifying steps, queues, delays, and information flows
3. Review the map to find delays, waste, and constraints
4. Create a new value stream map of the desired future state of the process, optimized to remove or reduce delays, waste, and constraints
5. Develop a roadmap for creating the optimized state
6. Plan to revisit the process in the future to continually refine and optimize it

##### Metrics

| Term                     | Formula                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Total cycle time         | $TCT=VAT+NVAT$           |
| Value-added time         | $VAT$                    |
| Nonvalue-added time      | $NVAT$                   |
| Process cycle efficiency | $VAT/TCT=VAT/(VAT+NVAT)$ |

#### Project Pre-Mortems

1. Imagine the Failure
2. Generate the Reasons for Failure
3. Consolidate the List
4. Revisit the Plan
