## Agile Principles and Mindset

### The Agile Mindset

#### Declaration of Interdependence (DOI)

* Written in 2005 by Agile Project Leadership Network
* Six Precepts:
> 1. We increase **return on investment** by making continuous flow of value our focus.
> 2. We **deliver reliable results** by engaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership.
> 3. We **expect uncertainty** and manage for it through iterations, anticipation, and adaptation.
> 4. We **unleash creativity** and innovation by recognizing that individuals are the ultimate source of value, and creating an environment where they can make a difference.
> 5. We **boost performance** through group accountability for results and shared responsibility for team effectiveness.
> 6. We **improve effectiveness and reliability** through situationally specific strategies, processes, and practices.

#### The Agile Triangle

| Methodology | Constraint | Variable   |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Predictive  | Scope      | Time, Cost |
| Agile       | Time, Cost | Scope      |

### The Agile Manifesto

#### Four Values

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding** to change over following a plan

#### Twelve Principles

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> Welcome changing requirements, even late indevelopment. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> Deliver working software frequently, from acouple of weeks to a couple of months, with apreference to the shorter timescale.
>
> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
>
> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,and trust them to get the job done.
>
> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a developmentteam is face-to-face conversation.
>
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be ableto maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
>
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
>
> Simplicity---the art of maximizing the amount of work not done---is essential.
>
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
>
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjustsits behavior accordingly.

### Agile Methodologies

* Scrum
* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Lean Product Development
* Kanban
* Feature-driven Development (FDD)
* Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
* Crystal

#### Scrum

##### Principles

* Transparency
* Inspection
* Adaptation

##### Values

* Focus
* Courage
* Openness
* Commitment
* Respect

##### Sprints

* Sprint = timeboxed iteration of < 1 month

Align project objectives with personal objectives to improve productivity

#### Management versus Leadership

| Management Focus   | Leadership             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Tasks/things       | People                 |
| Control            | Empowerment            |
| Efficiency         | Effectiveness          |

### Servant Leadership

Duties
* Shield the team from interruptions
* Remove impediments to progress
* Communicate
* "Carry food and water"

## Value-Driven Delivery

### Assessing Value

#### Financial Assessment Metrics

##### Return on Investment (ROI)

Formula: $ROI = Investment.Benefits/Investment.Cost$
Interpretation: $ROI>1$

##### Present Value (PV)

Formula: $PV = FV_t/(1+r)^t$

##### Net Present Value (NPV)

Formula: $NPV=\sum_{t=0}^{T} CF_t/(1+r)^t$

Interpretation:
* IF $NPV>0$ THEN accept ELSE reject
* Select project with **higher** $NPV$

##### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

Formula: $IRR = r : NPV(r) = 0$

Interpretation:
* IF $IRR>r$ THEN accept ELSE reject
* Select project with **higher** $IRR$

##### Payback Period

Formula: $T : NPV(T)=0$

Interpretation:
* IF $T<PB$ THEN accept ELSE reject
* Select project with **lower** $PB$

#### Earned Value Management

| $tVAC$         | $tEAC-\mathrm{PD}$      | Time Variance at Completion |

#### Agile Project Accounting

* Break down product/service into MVP
* Deliver MVP asap
* Exploit opportunities for early benefits by using part of the product/service while completing the remainder

#### Key Performance Indexes

* Rate of Progress
* Remaining Work
* Likely Completion Date
* Likely Costs Remaining

#### Regulatory Compliance

* Regulations $\rightarrow $ safety
* A project that is subejct to regulatory compliance require special documentation to prove that required practices were followed
* Approaches for integrating regulatory compliance:
  * Doing compliance work **during** product development to keep them linked and relevant
  * Doing compliance work **after** product development to avoid rework

### Prioritizing Value

#### Customer-Valued Prioritization

Work on items that maximize value delivered to customer first

#### Prioritization Schemes

##### MoSCoW

| Letter           | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **M**ust   |             |
| **S**hould |             |
| **C**ould  |             |
| **W**ould  |             |

##### Kano Analysis

* Delighters/exciters
* Satisfiers
* Dissatisfiers
* Indifferent

#### Relative Prioritization/Ranking

| Feature | Priority | MVP   |                            |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| A       | 1        | True  |                            |
| B       | 2        | True  |                            |

| ...     |          |       | Cutoff to meet budget/time |

### Deliver Incrementally

Delivering the "plain-vanilla" version of a product/service allows realizing benefits to get an early $ROI$

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

"Package of functionality that is complete enough to be useful to the users or the market, yet still small enough that it does not represent the entire project"

#### Agile Tooling

Prefer low tech, high touch tools over sophisticated computerized models

#### Task/Kanban Boards

#### Work in Progress (WIP)

* Work started but not started yet
* Excessive WIP:
  * consumes investment capital and delivers no $ROI$ until converted into product/service
  * hides bottlenecks/inefficiencies
  * increases probability of rework

#### WIP Limits

Set limit to WIP (to Task/Kanban Board)

Optimize ~~resource utilization~~ throughput

#### Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFDs)

Used for tracking and forecasting delivery of value

### (To Do) Agile Contracting

### Verifying and Validating Value

#### (To Do) Frequent Verification and Validation

#### Testing and Verification in Software Development

##### Continuous Integration

  * Source code control system
  * Build tools
  * Test tools
  * Scheduler/trigger
  * Notifications

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Stakeholder Engagement

### Establishing a Shared Vision

#### Agile Chartering

##### Agile versus Non-Agile Charters

##### Developing an Agile Charter

W5H questions:

* Who will be engaged?
* What is this project about?
* Where will it occur?
* When will it start and end?
* Why is it being undertaken?
* How will it be undertaken?

Project elevator statement:

| For     | Target customers                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Who:    | Need                               |
| The:    | Product/service name               |
| Is a:   | Product category                   |
| That:   | Key benefits/reason to buy         |
| Unlike: | Primary competitive alternative(s) |

* User Stories

Consist of multiple **acceptance criteria**

#### Agile Modeling

Types:
* Use case diagrams

Help empathize with final users of product/service

Keep focus on delivering features that users will find valuable

##### Process

1. Identify product/service to be analyzed
2. Create a value stream map of the current process, identifying steps, queues, delays, and information flows
3. Review the map to find delays, waste, and constraints
4. Create a new value stream map of the desired future state of the process, optimized to remove or reduce delays, waste, and constraints
5. Develop a roadmap for creating the optimized state
6. Plan to revisit the process in the future to continually refine and optimize it
