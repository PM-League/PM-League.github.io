PM Processes
============

PM Process Application
----------------------

The following PM processes

-  should be used during a project as a whole, for individual phases, or
   both,
-  are appropriate for projects in all organizations.

PM requires significant coordination and, as such, requires each process
to be

-  appropriately aligned, and
-  connected with other processes.

Some processes may be repeated to

-  fully define and meet stakeholder requirements, and
-  reach an agreement on the project objectives.

In conjunction with other project stakeholders, project managers are
advised to

-  carefully consider the processes, and
-  apply them as appropriate to the project and organizational needs.

| The processes need not be applied uniformly on all projects or phases.
| Therefore, the project manager should tailor the management processes
  for each project or phase by determining

-  what processes are appropriate, and
-  the degree of rigor for each process. The relevant organizational
   policies should accomplish this tailoring.

For a project to be successful, the following actions should be
accomplished:

-  select appropriate processes that are required to meet the project
   objectives;
-  use a defined approach to develop or adapt the product specifications
   and plans to meet the project objectives and requirements;
-  comply with requirements to satisfy the project sponsor, customers,
   and other stakeholders;
-  define and manage the project scope within the constraints while
   considering the project risks and resource needs to provide the
   project deliverables;
-  obtain proper support from each performing organization, including a
   commitment from the customers and project sponsor.

The PM processes are defined and described in terms of their purposes,
the relationships among the processes, the interactions within the
processes, and the primary inputs and outputs associated with each
process.

Process Groups and Subject Groups
---------------------------------

General
~~~~~~~

The PM processes may be viewed from two different perspectives:

-  as **process groups** for the management of the project;
-  as **subject groups** for collecting the processes by subject.

Process Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _general-1:

General
^^^^^^^

| Each **process group** consists of processes that apply to any project
  phase or project.
| These processes, further defined in terms of purpose, description, and
  primary inputs and outputs, are interdependent.
| The process groups are independent of the application area or industry
  focus. Any process may be repeated.

Initiating
^^^^^^^^^^

The *initiating* processes are used to

-  start a project phase or project,
-  define the project phase or project objectives, and
-  authorize the project manager to proceed with the project work.

Planning
^^^^^^^^

The *planning* processes are used to develop planning detail.

This detail should be sufficient to

-  establish baselines against which project implementation can be
   managed, and
-  performance can be measured and controlled.

Implementing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *implementing* processes are used to

-  perform the project management activities, and
-  support the provision of the project’s deliverables following the
   project plans.

Controlling
^^^^^^^^^^^

| The *controlling* processes are used to monitor, measure, and control
  project performance against the project plan.
| Consequently, preventive and corrective actions may be taken and
  change requests made to achieve project objectives when necessary.

Closing
^^^^^^^

The *closing* processes are used to

-  formally establish that the project phase or project is finished, and
-  provide lessons learned to be considered and implemented as
   necessary.

PM Process Group Interrelationships and Interactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The management of a project

-  starts with the initiating process group, and
-  finishes with the closing process group.

The interdependency between process groups requires the controlling
process group to interact with every other process group.

+========================================+
| Figure 1 — Process groups interactions |
+----------------------------------------+

Process groups are

-  seldom discrete or one-time in their application.
-  repeated within each phase to drive the project to completion.
   All or some processes within the process groups may be required for a
   project phase.
   Not all interactions will apply to all project phases or projects.
   In practice, the processes within the process groups are often
-  concurrent,
-  overlapping, and
-  interacting in ways not shown.

| Figure 2 elaborates on Figure 1 to show the interactions among the
  process groups inside the project's boundaries, including the
  representative inputs and outputs of processes within the process
  groups.
| Except for the controlling process group, linkages between the various
  process groups are through individual processes within each process
  group.
| While linkage is shown in Figure 2 between the controlling process
  group and other process groups, it may be considered self-standing
  because its processes control the overall project and the individual
  process groups.

Subject Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _general-2:

General
^^^^^^^

| Each **subject group** consists of processes applicable to any project
  phase or project.
| These processes

-  are defined in terms of

   -  purpose,
   -  description,
   -  primary inputs and outputs, and

-  are interdependent.

Subject groups are independent of the application area or industry
focus.

| The figures in Annex A illustrate the interactions of the individual
  processes in each process group identified in 4.2.2 mapped against the
  subject groups.
| Any process may be repeated.

Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^

The *integration* subject group includes

-  the processes required to identify, define, combine, unify,
   coordinate, control, and close the various activities, and
-  the processes related to the project.

Stakeholder
^^^^^^^^^^^

The *stakeholder* subject group includes the processes required to
identify and manage the project sponsor, customers, and other
stakeholders.

Scope
^^^^^

The *scope* subject group includes

-  the processes required to identify and define the work and
   deliverables, and
-  only the work and deliverables required.

Resource
^^^^^^^^

The *resource* subject group includes the processes required to identify
and acquire adequate project resources such as

-  people,
-  facilities,
-  equipment,
-  materials,
-  infrastructure, and
-  tools.

Time
^^^^

The *time* subject group includes the processes required to

-  schedule the project activities, and
-  to monitor progress in controlling the schedule.

Cost
^^^^

The *cost* subject group includes the processes required to

-  develop the budget, and
-  monitor progress to control costs.

Risk
^^^^

The *risk* subject group includes the processes required to identify and
manage threats and opportunities.

Quality
^^^^^^^

The *quality* subject group includes the processes required to plan and
establish quality assurance and control.

Procurement
^^^^^^^^^^^

The *procurement* subject group includes the processes required to

-  plan and acquire products, services or results, and
-  manage supplier relationships.

Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *communication* subject group includes the processes required to
plan, manage and distribute information relevant to the project.
