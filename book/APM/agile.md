## Agile Principles and Mindset

### The Agile Manifesto

#### Four Values

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding** to change over following a plan

#### Twelve Principles

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
>
> Welcome changing requirements, even late indevelopment. Agile processes harness change forthe customer's competitive advantage
>
> Deliver working software frequently, from acouple of weeks to a couple of months, with apreference to the shorter timescale
>
> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
>
> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,and trust them to get the job done
>
> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a developmentteam is face-to-face conversation
>
> Working software is the primary measure of progress
>
> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be ableto maintain a constant pace indefinitely
>
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
>
> Simplicity---the art of maximizing the amount of work not done---is essential
>
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
>
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjustsits behavior accordingly

## Value-Driven Delivery

### Assessing Value

#### Financial Assessment Metrics

##### Return on Investment (ROI)

###### Formula

$$
ROI = Benefits/Investment
$$

##### Present Value (PV)

$$
PV = FV_t/(1+r)^t
$$

##### Net Present Value (NPV)

###### Formula

$$
NPV=\sum_{t=0}^{T} CF_t/(1+r)^t
$$

###### Interpretation

IF $$NPV>0$$ THEN accept ELSE reject

##### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

###### Formula

$$
IRR = r : NPV(r) = 0
$$

###### Interpretation

IF $$IRR>r$$ THEN accept ELSE reject

##### Payback Period

###### Formula

$$
T : NPV(T)=0
$$

###### Interpretation

IF $$T<PB$$ THEN accept ELSE reject

#### Earned Value Management

##### Metrics
